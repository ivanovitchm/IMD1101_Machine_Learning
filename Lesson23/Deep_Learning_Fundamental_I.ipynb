In a black box model, we can understand the inputs and the outputs but the intermediate features are actually difficult to interpret and understand.

        "\n",
        "Second, images are often downsampled to lower resolutions and transformed to grayscale (no color). This is a limitation of compute power unfortunately. The resolution of a 8 megapixel photo has 3264 by 2448 pixels, for a total of 7,990,272 features (or about 8 million). Images of this resolution are usually scaled down to between 128 and 512 pixels in either direction for significantly faster processing. This often results in a loss of detail that's available for training and pattern matching.\n",
        "\n",
        "Third, the features in an image don't have an obvious linear or nonlinear relationship that can be learned with a model like linear or logistic regression. In grayscale, each pixel is just represented as a brightness value ranging from 0 to 256.\n",
