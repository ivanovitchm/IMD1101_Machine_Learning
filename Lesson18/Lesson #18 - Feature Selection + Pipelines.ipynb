Every process has some inherent amount of randomness that we can't measure and understanding the role of chance helps us reach a conclusion that's more likely to be correct.\n","\n","We first set up a **null hypothesis** that describes the status quo. We then state an **alternative hypothesis**, which we used to compare with the **null hypothesis** to decide which describes the data better.

Group A is referred to as the **control group** while group B is referred to as the **treatment group**. This type of study is called a [blind experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment) since the participants didn't know which pill they were receiving. This helps us reduce the potential bias that is introduced when participants know which pill they were given. For example, participants who are aware they were given the weight loss pill may try to add healthier foods to their diet to help them lose more weight. Both groups were weighed before the study began and a month later, after the study ended.\n","\n","Understanding the **research design** for a study is an important first step that informs the rest of your analysis. It helps us uncover potential flaws in the study that we need to keep in mind as we dive deeper. The weight loss pill study we conducted is known as an experimental study. Experimental studies usually involve bringing in participants, instructing them to perform some tasks, and observing them. A key part of running an experimental study is random assignment, which involves assigning participants in the study to random groups without revealing which group each participant is in. Before exploring and analyzing a dataset, it's important to understand how the study was conducted. Flaws in how the study was run can lead you to reach the wrong conclusions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"SJg9ZkRizShD","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### 1.1.3 Statistical significance"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4gXh35W5zhcy","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Statistics helps us determine if the difference in the weight lost between the 2 groups (A and B) is because of random chance or because of an actual difference in the outcomes.

The goal is to calculate a distribution of the test statistics over these many iterations. This distribution is called the **sampling distribution** and it approximates the full range of possible test statistics under the null hypothesis. We can then benchmark the test statistic we observed in the data (a mean difference of 2.52) to determine how likely it is to observe this mean difference under the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, that the weight loss pill doesn't help people lose more weight, than the observed mean difference of 2.52 should be quite common in the sampling distribution. If it's instead extremely rare, then we accept the alternative hypothesis instead.\n","\n","To simulate rerunning the study, we randomly reassign each data point (weight lost) to either group A or group B. We keep track of the recalculated test statistics as a separate list. By re-randomizing the groups that the weight loss values belong to, we're simulating what randomly generated groupings of these weight loss values would look like. We then use these randomly generated groupings to understand how rare the groupings in our actual data were.\n","\n","Ideally, the number of times we re-randomize the groups that each data point belongs to matches the total number of possible permutations. Usually, the number of total permutations is too high for even powerful supercomputers to calculate within a reasonable time frame. While we'll use 1000 iterations for now since we'll get the results back quickly, in later we'll learn how to quantify the tradeoff we make between accuracy and speed to determine the optimal number of iterations.\n","\n","Since we'll be randomizing the groups each value belongs to, we created a list named **all_values** that contains just the weight loss values."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"PfytVHcGRdX1","colab_type":"code","outputId":"0a034039-513f-4f44-e471-270cff02fb62","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1567892910796,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":829,"user":{"displayName":"Ivanovitch
