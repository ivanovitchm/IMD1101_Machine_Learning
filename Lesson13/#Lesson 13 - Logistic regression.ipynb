Linear regression works well when the target column we're trying to predict, the dependent variable, is ordered and continuous. **If the target column instead contains discrete values, then linear regression isn't a good fit**.\n","\n","In this lesson, we'll explore how to build a predictive model for these types of problems, which are known as **classification problems**. In classification, our target column has a finite set of possible values which represent different categories a row can belong to. We use integers to represent the different categories so we can continue to use mathematical functions to describe how the independent variables map to the dependent variable. Here are a few examples of classification problems:\n","\n","| Problem                                                                   | Sample Features                                    | Type        | Categories           | Numerical Categories |\n","|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n","| Should we accept this student based on their graduate school application? | College GPA, SAT Score, Quality of Recommendations | Binary      | Don't Accept, Accept | 0, 1                 |\n","| What is the most likely blood type of 2 parent's offspring?               | Parent 1's blood type, Parent 2's blood type.      | Multi-class | A, B, AB, O          | 1, 2, 3, 4           |\n","\n","\n","We'll focus on **binary classification** for now, where the only 2 options for values are:\n","\n","- **0** for the False condition,\n","- **1** for the True condition.\n","\n","Before we dive into classification, let's understand the data we'll be working with."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"2wMlyd4AITqv"},"source":["## 1.1 Introduction to the data\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"MW5u3eDhNRD1"},"source":["\n","\n","Every year high school student and college students apply to various universities and programs. Each student has a unique set of test scores, grades, and backgrounds. Somehow, the admission commitees must decide which applicants to accept or reject from their program. In this case a binary classification algorithm can be used to accept or reject applicants. To grasp the concepts of classification, we'll try to predict whether an applicant will be admitted to a graduate program in a U.S. university.\n","\n","We'll be working with a dataset containing data on 644 applicants with the following columns:\n","\n","- **gre** - applicant's score on the Graduate Record Exam, a generalized test for prospective graduate students.\n","    - Score ranges from 200 to 800.\n","- **gpa** - college grade point average.\n","    - Continuous between 0.0 and 4.0.\n","- **admit** - binary value\n","    - Binary value, 0 or 1, where 1 means the applicant was admitted to the program and 0 means the applicant was rejected.\n","\n","Here's a preview of the dataset:\n","\n","| admit | gpa      | gre        |\n","|-------|----------|------------|\n","| 0     | 3.177277 | 594.102992 |\n","| 0     | 3.412655 | 631.528607 |\n","| 0     | 2.728097 | 553.714399 |\n","| 0     | 3.093559 | 551.089985 |\n","| 0     | 3.141923 | 537.184894 |\n","\n","\n","While we can use both the **gpa** and **gre** columns to predict the **admit** column, we'll focus on using just the **gpa** column to keep things simple.

When we have three or more categories, we call the problem a **multiclass classification problem**. There are a few different methods of doing multiclass classification and in this section, we'll focus on the **one-versus-all method**.\n","\n","The **one-versus-all** method is a technique where we choose a single category as the Positive case and group the rest of the categories as the False case. **We're essentially splitting the problem into multiple binary classification problems.** For each observation, the model will then output the probability of belonging to each category.\n","\n","To start let's split our data into a training and test set.
